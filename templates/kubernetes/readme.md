Understood. If you're just looking to work with YAML directly, without any programming, here are examples of how to create and update a YAML file manually:

### Creating a YAML File

You can create a YAML file using any text editor. Here's an example of a simple YAML file content, which you might save as `example.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysecret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=  # base64 encoded value of 'admin'
  password: MWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm  # base64 encoded value of '1f2d1e2e67df'
```

### Updating a YAML File

To update a YAML file, you simply edit the existing file. For example, if you want to update the `password` field in the `example.yaml` file, you would modify it like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysecret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=  # remains the same
  password: bmv3cGFzc3dvcmQ=  # new base64 encoded value
```

### Editing Tips

- Use a text editor like Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text for editing YAML files.
- Pay attention to indentation, as it is crucial in YAML files.
- Ensure that the structure of the YAML file (like hierarchies and alignments) is maintained correctly after editing.
- After making changes, you can use online YAML validators to check if the YAML is correctly formatted.

To apply a YAML file in Kubernetes and then reference it in your deployments or other Kubernetes resources, follow these steps:

### 1. Apply the YAML File in Kubernetes

Once you have your YAML file ready (for example, `mysecret.yaml` for a Secret), you can apply it to your Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl` command line tool. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f mysecret.yaml
```

This command will create the Secret (or other resource defined in your YAML file) in your Kubernetes cluster.

### 2. Referencing the Secret in a Deployment

To use the created secret in a Kubernetes Deployment, you reference it in your Deployment YAML file. For example, if you want to use `mysecret` as environment variables in a Deployment, your Deployment YAML might look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: myapp-image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
          - name: USERNAME
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysecret
                key: username
          - name: PASSWORD
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysecret
                key: password
```

In this example, the Deployment `myapp-deployment` will have pods containing containers that use `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` environment variables, which are set to the values from the `mysecret` Secret.

### Applying the Deployment

Apply this Deployment in the same way as you applied the Secret:

```bash
kubectl apply -f myapp-deployment.yaml
```

### Important Notes

- **Secrets are Base64 Encoded**: Remember that in your Secret YAML file, the data fields should be base64 encoded. In the example above, `YWRtaW4=` corresponds to the base64 encoded version of `admin`, and `MWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm` is the base64 encoded version of a hypothetical password.
- **Pod Restart**: If the secret is updated, the pods using the secret might need to be restarted to pick up the new values.
- **Security**: Treat your secrets with care. Avoid exposing them in your configurations or logs.
- **Namespace Consistency**: Ensure that the Secret and the Deployment are in the same Kubernetes namespace, or specify the namespace explicitly in your configurations.
